This repository contains documentation from a summer research internship project conducted in 2019. The project aimed to estimate the likelihood of a tweet being retweeted, using **topological metrics** derived from the **Twitter Higgs Dataset**. The work involved constructing and analyzing the **social graph** and **retweet graph**, followed by building a **binary classification model** using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs).

The study was conducted using Python, with a focus on network science and statistical modeling, and involved significant use of the **NetworkX** library and **H2O.ai** for predictive modeling.

## 🌍 Why This Is Public

This work is shared openly for anyone who may benefit from studying social graph topology, retweet prediction, or real-world research applications using NetworkX and the Higgs dataset. I hope this serves as a reference or inspiration to students, researchers, or curious minds working on network-based prediction problems.

### Final Words

Though it didn’t become a publication, it shaped my learning deeply. 
I’m sharing it now as a mark of honoring that effort and my former self who carried so much of this work with silent strength.
